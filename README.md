# HNO-Stealth-System
Scripted light &amp; FOV-based stealth system. SneakLight script attached to all lights participating in the system, computes proximity to player and sends output to StealthManager. StealthManager attached to an invisible dummy object, receives input from all lights in an interior and computes eligibility for the player's "illuminated" state (player sufficiently close to >1 light). HNOStealthScript attached to any NPC participating in the system, computes position of player within NPC's field of vision, integrates illuminated state information from StealthManager and decides whether or not player is visible.
